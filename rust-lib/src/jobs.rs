//! The board a deferred answer is parked on while its outbound calls are in
//! flight — the state an async call site needs and a synchronous one did not.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. This module is the wallet's COORDINATOR: almost every
//! method it has is one or more calls to `eth_rpc_module`, `keystore_module`,
//! `token_list_module`, `fee_module` or `uniswap_module`. On a `web` (wasm)
//! image those calls can only be made with the generated `_async` clients: a
//! Worker is a single event loop with no ASYNCIFY (ADR 0004), so a call that
//! blocked for its reply would deadlock the loop that delivers it, and
//! logos-rust-sdk does not compile the synchronous `lp_invoke` there at all.
//!
//! An async call has no return value, so a method that starts one cannot answer
//! in the same breath. It answers a JOB ID, and the caller collects with
//! `take_result`.
//!
//! IT IS A `static`, NOT A FIELD, at the call sites: the callback the door
//! takes is `FnOnce + Send + 'static` and cannot borrow the module. That is
//! true of every async callback in the SDK, not a property of this module.
//!
//! LIFTED VERBATIM FROM `uniswap_module` (#167 Part A), deliberately: the two
//! boards are the same object and a second, subtly different one would be worse
//! than a copy. Its own module doc already calls it "a candidate to lift into
//! the rust SDK", which is where the copy should end.
//!
//! No Logos/Qt dependency here on purpose — this compiles and is unit-tested
//! with `cargo test --no-default-features`, like `txbuild`, `config` and
//! `history`.
